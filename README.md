# nartc

I am currently working as a Development Engineer for [ArchitectNow](https://github.com/architectNow). Outside of work, I contribute to open source libraries such as [nestjs/swagger](https://github.com/nestjs/swagger) and various other libraries. I am also the creator and maintainer of [nartc/automapper](https://github.com/nartc/mapper) which is my implementation for **AutoMapper in TypeScript**.
